          <p>Description is based on Wright's Catalogue without consultation of physical
            manuscripts. Foliation is approximate. Wright often does not indicate ending folia so
            those have been assumed based on beginning folia.</p>
          <p>Scribal notes which could not be more clearly classified based on Wright's descriptions
            have been identified as &lt;addition&gt;s whether they occur in the margins or the body
            of the manuscript.</p>
          <p>In general, we have classified as an &lt;msItem&gt; as much of the manuscript contents
            as possible, including tables of contents and indices.</p>
